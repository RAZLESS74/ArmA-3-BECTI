<h1 align="center"> ArmA 3 - Project BECTI </h1>

Welcome to the GITHUB for the 'open source' project BECTI. BECTI is a mission created by Benny in the early ArmA 3 days. With this project we aim for it to update BECTI, improve the project and make it compatible with some mods and maps.

## What is CTI?
CTI (Capture the Island) is a Gamemode that was made by bohemia in ArmA 2 where two sides, West and East fight for the control of an
island. Each side are led by a Commander (Player or AI) which may construct a base thanks to the MHQ (Mobile HQ). As soon as the base is 
available, you may decide to reinforce your team by purchasing additional units and vehicles. Keep in mind that the Commander may assign 
assign different tasks to your team. The mission may be won by destroying the opposite side's base assets (Barracks,Light Vehicle Factory, 
Heavy Vehicle Factory, Aircraft Factory and the MHQ). Money and Supplies are gathered from capturing towns. Expect some resistance of some 
local militia at the towns tho!

## How do I play and install it?
First download the mission trough the <a href="">STEAMWORKSHOP (Not available on the workshop yet)</a> or trough the Releases page.
If you Didn't download the mission from the workshop put the desired PBO file in the MPMissions folder on your server or in 
`C:/programfiles/steam/steamapps/common/ArmA3/mpmissions` (Path may varray on your system) 

Start your Server with the needed mods for the template that you want to run or Start your ArmA 3 (also with the needed mods) go to 
multiplayer press host and select the mission. When you are in the slot selection screen select your side, a slot (doesn't matter which 
one) and setup the Parameters (Mission Options) by clicking on the parameters button when you are logged in as admin or when you host 
the server. If you want to play on your own or with all players on 1 team enabling AI Commander and AI teams is recommended.

All required mods can be found on the Steam Workshop Page of the mission or in the Missions.text in the release ZIP/pbo's folder!
